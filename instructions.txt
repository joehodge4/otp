OTP. 

You have managed to obtain the copy of the software used to reset a password
(which in this case, will get you the password). The software first do a quick
check that the user interacting with it is human, then asks for the favourite
UK City of the user (which was pre-recorded and stored as an MD5 hash in
the software) and finally asks for a Time-based OTP, which is a number
between 0 and 999 that changes every 100 seconds.

If you can answer all the questions correctly, the software will display
the flag.
